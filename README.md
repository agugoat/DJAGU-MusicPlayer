# DJAGU-MusicPlayer


functional music player This is a passion project, birthed off the fact that I want to stop paying 20 dollars a month for virtual DJ. The music player so far has the functionality to play wav files only. Pause and play from a certian point and allows easy wav file upload and play.

Built so far using Java Libaries include - Java Swing, Java Sound, Junit Testing, Abstract Window Toolkit.
