# DJAGU-MusicPlayer
functional music player
This is a passion project, birthed off the fact that I want to stop paying 20 dollars a month for virtual DJ.
The music player so far has the functionality to play wav files only.
Pause and play from a certian point and allows easy wav file upload and play.

Built so far using Java 
Libaries include - Java Swing, Java Sound, Junit Testing, Abstract Window Toolkit.
